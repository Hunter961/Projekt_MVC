        <h3>What's MVC about?</h3>
        <p>
            <i><a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC">ASP.NET MVC</a></i> is basically a web development framework from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, which combines the features of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the most up-to-date ideas and techniques from Agile development, and the best parts of the existing <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> platform.
        </p>
        <p>It's not something, which is built from ground zero. It is a complete alternative to traditional <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> Web Forms. It is built on the top of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, which combines the features of MVC <dfn>(Model-View-Controller)</dfn> architecture, the most up-to-date ideas and techniques from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> development, and the best parts of the existing <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a>, so developers enjoy almost all the ASP.NET features while building the MVC application.</p>

    <h3>What's Entity Framework?</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/"><i>Entity Framework</i></a> (EF) is an open source <dfn>object-relational mapping</dfn> (ORM) framework for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ado-net-overview">ADO.NET</a>. It was a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a>, but since Entity Framework version 6 it is separated from .NET framework.

    </p>
        <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data source specific providers, which abstract the ADO.NET interfaces to connect to the database when programming against the conceptual schema.</li>
            <li>Map provider, a database-specific provider that translates the Entity SQL command tree into a query in the native SQL flavor of the database.</li>
            <li>EDM parser and view mapping, which takes the SDL specification of the data model and how it maps onto the underlying relational model and enables programming against the   conceptual model.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Entity Data Model</h3>

        <p>
            The entity data model (EDM) specifies the conceptual model (CSDL) of the data, using a modelling technique that is itself called Entity Data Model, an extended version of the Entity-Relationship model. The data model primarily describes the Entities and the Associations they participate in.
        </p>

        <p>
            The EDM schema is expressed in the Schema Definition Language (SDL), which is an application of XML (Extended markup language). In addition, the mapping (MSL) of the elements of the conceptual schema (CSDL) to the storage schema (SSDL) must also be specified. The mapping specification is also expressed in XML
